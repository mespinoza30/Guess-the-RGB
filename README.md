# Guess the RGB
This is an interactive game that tests the player's RGB knowledge. After clicking new colors, the RGB numbers will be displayed and 3 different colors will be shown in the boxes. The player will then have to decide which is the correct RGB.



### Motivation
What motivated me to make this game was that it seemed challenging enough to test my JavaScript knowledge. I was able to implement what I learned all while pushing me to learn new JavaScript techniques.

### Future development
What are the next steps for the project? How will you continue to evolve it?

* In the future I would like to evolve it by adding an amount of guesses the player can make.
* I would also add a section that has lives and decreases with every incorrect guess
* Lastly, I would like to add 3 more boxes to the game to make the game a little more challenging.
