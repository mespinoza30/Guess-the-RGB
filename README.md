# Guess the RGB
This is an interactive game that tests the player's RGB knowledge. After clicking new colors, the RGB numbers will be displayed and 3 different colors will be shown in the boxes. The player will then have to decide which is the correct RGB.



### Motivation
What motivated me to make this game was that it seemed challenging enough to test my JavaScript knowledge. I was able to implement what I learned all while pushing me to learn new JavaScript techniques.
